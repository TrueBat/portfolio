                <h3>I was initially interested in the course because of its title, but the main reason I took it was
                    because I needed the 3 credits. However, after finishing the course, I can only say that I'm glad I
                    took it. Although I'm not someone who usually likes elective courses, I can confidently say that
                    this course was even better than some core courses. Each lecture was not only informative but also
                    remarkably engaging and interactive. Moreover, the course proved undeniably beneficial as it
                    imparted essential skills applicable across various fields, ranging from personal development and
                    self-awareness to communication skills and leadership abilities.</h3>

                <h3>Dear Hiring Manager of Murex,<br>
                    I am writing to express my strong interest in the software engineer position at Murex. With a solid
                    background in software development and a passion for creating innovative solutions, I am confident
                    that my skills and experience align perfectly with the requirements of the role.
                    Throughout my career, I have gained extensive experience in developing software programs. I am
                    well-versed in various programming languages such as Java, Python, and C++. I thrive in dynamic and
                    challenging environments, and I am eager to contribute my expertise to Murex's renowned software
                    development team. <br>
                    Beyond technical proficiency, I am also a strong communicator and believe in fostering positive
                    working relationships. I am adept at translating complex technical concepts into clear and concise
                    language, enabling effective communication with both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
                    Furthermore, my ability to adapt quickly to new technologies and methodologies will enable me to
                    contribute to Murex's dedication to innovation and continuous improvement.
                    Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how I can
                    contribute to the success of Murex in greater detail.<br>
                    Sincerely,<br>
                    Mohammad Karim Abo Hosa
